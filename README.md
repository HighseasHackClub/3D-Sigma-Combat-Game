# 3D-Sigma-Combat-Game
Sigma fights to survive

Pretty much just a wave-survival combat game that I made, it features:

 Physics 

Random world generation 

Engaging combat 

Engaging attack system 

Three unique monsters 

Hella animations and particles timed with many events 

AI for NPCS 

Much more to come!

I tried to use outside resources as little as possible, but it was pretty much unavoidable when designing textures and other models. The game is kind-of incomplete, but this was mainly for me to learn, and the hackclub was an added bonus, however I will likely never make this game complete, as I want to work on something bigger.
